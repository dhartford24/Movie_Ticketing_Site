# Movie_Ticketing_Site

Created the backend development for a movie ticketing website similar to Fandango or MovieTickets.  This program will display the movies out in theaters along with search options for movies based on the movie title, genre, rating, runtime, and theater it is being played in.  The program will also give information about different theaters in the area based on quality of the theater, number of screens, and its location.

All this will be accomplished using Java, Spring, Hibernate, Git, Maven, Relational Database Management, MySQL, REST APIs, HTTP, JPA, and JUnit testing.
